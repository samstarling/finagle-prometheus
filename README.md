# finagle-prometheus

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samstarling/finagle-prometheus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samstarling/finagle-prometheus) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/samstarling/finagle-prometheus/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/samstarling/finagle-prometheus?branch=master)

A library that provides a bridge between Finagle and Prometheus. It contains everything you need to get metrics from a Finagle service into Prometheus.

I am currently in the process of publishing the library to Sonatype's central repository. When that's done, the dependency will be:

```
"com.samstarling" %% "finagle-prometheus" % "0.0.1"
```
