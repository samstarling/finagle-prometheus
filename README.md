# finagle-prometheus

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samstarling/prometheus-autocomplete.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samstarling/prometheus-autocomplete)

A library that provides a bridge between Finagle and Prometheus. It contains everything you need to get statistics from a Finagle service into Prometheus.

It is currently work in progress, and is not yet published anywhere. There is an example of how it all hangs together in the form of a `TestServer`.
